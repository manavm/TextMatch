is a Growth Mindset? Think about Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan. These two athletes are legends in their sports. How many times have you heard people say, â€œthey were born to play golf /basketball?â€ Do you believe when it comes to achieving success you were either born with the ability and skills to make it or not? There are two ways of looking at this: with a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. A fixed mindset is a belief that your intelligence is innate/you were born with it. A growth mindset, on the other hand, is a belief that success is a combination of the aptitude youâ€™re born with AND the amount of effort and hard work you put in. We don't know if Michael or Tiger were \"born champions\" but here's what we do know: Tiger started playing golf at age 2 and has practiced for hours every day since then to achieve the success he has today. Michael Jordan similarly practiced 3-4 hours every day to build on some of the innate skills he may have been born with. Without all of this practice and hard work, would these two champions have achieved the success they have today? Malcolm Gladwell, an author and sociologist, wrote a book called Outliers. In it, he says, \"The closer psychologists look at the careers of the gifted, the smaller the role innate talent seems to play and the bigger the role preparation seems to play.\" He found that the most talented students, musicians and athletes had gradually increased their practice while growing up until they had logged over 10,000 hours by the age of 20. The magic number seems to be 10,000 hours. That's the equivalent of about 20 hours of practice every week for 10 years.

Paragraph #2: In your own wordsâ€¦ - How would you define a Growth Mindset in your own words? -Do you believe that Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan use a Growth Mindset in their own lives? Why or why not? - Think of another example of someone you consider to be very successful (either a celebrity or someone in your own life) and talk about how that person has used a Growth Mindset to achieve their success.

SIGN OFF: Wrap up your email and say goodbye. Mentor Email Mentor Tip:A Growth Mindset is a key non-academic skill we want our mentees to start embracing. To adopt a belief that YOU are in control of your own success because you can work hard and achieve your goals can be a very empowering outlook. As a mentor, constantly reminding your mentee that their hard work and effort can help them achieve their goals; that they are active participants in building their future will help keep them motivated to work toward the goals theyâ€™ve set for themselves. A fixed mindset is limiting, while a growth mindset allows us to believe that we can work hard toward anything. Obviously itâ€™s important to point out to your mentee that working hard does not guarantee success, nor does it mean that things wonâ€™t be challenging along the way, but working hard and putting the effort in will always get you farther than not doing those things. Paragraph #1: Our Ritual: Share one â€œhighâ€ (or event, experience, moment that was very positive from the last week) and one â€œlowâ€ (event, experience, moment that was negative from the last week). Keep the conversation going by responding to your menteeâ€™s thoughts about how they use a Growth Mindset in their own lives. -How have you seen your mentee use a Growth Mindset so far this year? -Validate how your mentee thinks theyâ€™ve used a Growth mindset and add on to what theyâ€™ve shared. -If your mentee doesnâ€™t agree with a Growth Mindset but rather believes that a Fixed Mindset is more accurate, restate the definition of each and help clarify the benefits of a Growth Mindset. Paragraph #2: In your own wordsâ€¦ - How would you define a Growth Mindset in your own words? Make sure to highlight the similarities in your definition and your menteeâ€™s definition and to emphasize that intelligence is changeable in your definition. Help your mentee understand what that really means. -Do you believe that Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan use a Growth Mindset in their own lives? Why or why not? - Think of another example of someone you consider to be very successful (either a celebrity or someone in your own life) and talk about how that person has used a Growth Mindset to achieve their success. Paragraph #3: What about you? - Do you live by a Growth Mindset? How? -Tell your mentee about a specific example of how youâ€™ve used a Growth Mindset recently"}}

bill,I am good, thanks for asking. Happy it is Friday, and I am looking forward to the weekend even though I am going to spend it studying for a big test I have coming up. That is actually why I can't make it to the next iMentor session. I am sorry about missing the session by the way, but I have my test and I cannot reschedule it. I think my high this week was having Monday off of work and the short week. My low this week is probably all of the studying I have been doing for my big test. It is really not much of a low because it is not that bad to study for. It is for something I really want to do well in, so it is not that hard to motivate myself to work hard.I think you described a \"growth mindset\" very well. I absolutely agree that working hard and preparation makes all the difference in the world if you want to be good at something. I try to apply this to many aspects of life. One of the most common sayings that I try to apply to everyday life is \"practice makes perfect.\" Whether you know it or not, you are building habits right now that you will carry with you for the rest of your life. If you practice hard work and focus on little tasks like homework and classwork, you will get better and better at these types of tasks. It is important to start embracing that kind of attitude because the work you put in now will pay off in the future. I know that if you work hard towards your goals and commit yourself to accomplishing them that you are fully capable of making it happen. That is why I am so excited that you said you want to practice doing all your work and a doing a good job on it. That is a great habit that will help prepare you for college. It is also really excited to see how hard you have worked since we started iMentor together. I have definitely noticed you working harder in school, and that is really exciting for me.One thing that I think is important to note is that the right \"growth mindset\" works for intelligence and school too. I remember when you told me last week that when you first came to high school, you were a little self concious because you thought that since every one was older than you that therefore they were smarter than you. But it made me really happy to hear that you don't feel that way anymore. I think this is because you applied your \"growth mindset\" to school and developed more skills that make you feel comfortable in school. Keep us the positive attitude in school and I know you were feel more and more intelligent as you work hard at it. I look at my Dad as an example. He works hard at his new job because he lost his last job due to the bad economy. He started his own company and worked hard at it. And now he is doing very well with his new company.Every day, I try to think about what I want to achieve and start working at it. I think of new challenges that I want to overcome. One example of this is my test coming up that is important to me. One of my goals was to go back to school for my graduate degree. As a result, I practice for my business school admissions test. I challenged myself to achieve a certain score and practice hard to accomplish that every day. Hopefully, my hard work will pay off.joe"}}
