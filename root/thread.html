          <p class='email'>Hey its joe again my high for the week is having no school for 4 day and my low for the week is getting sick. Also today I'm going to see my besfriend and we're going to go to the movie and other Growth mindset to me is that sometime people go to grow up to fast at a young age and sometimes you can be 35 and act like a 10 year old. My heros is deadpool and lady gaga also growth mindset is  important to me because sometimes a child can get out of hand. well I to go now bye<img alt="Cool" border="0" src="https://imentor.imentorinteractive.org/media/js/tinymce-3.5.7/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-cool.gif" title="Cool" /><img alt="Smile" border="0" src="https://imentor.imentorinteractive.org/media/js/tinymce-3.5.7/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-smile.gif" title="Smile" /><img alt="Surprised" border="0" src="https://imentor.imentorinteractive.org/media/js/tinymce-3.5.7/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-surprised.gif" title="Surprised" /></p>

          <p class='email'>Hi bill,Thanks for your email, it made my day after a very rough day at work!! It was great seeing you last week :) I'm glad you've been thinking more about college. It's such an exciting experience, you will learn so much about the world and who you are.  I hope you have a great day at school tomorrow, and a great weekend!  Any plans other than your usual dance classes? Have fun and talk to you soon!  joep.s. If you haven't already, don't forget to bring the out of program form that your dad signed! I can't make it to the event on the 7th so we definitely need to hang out on our own.</p>

          <div class='email'>PK-- <p class="p1">so you got to drive over break? that's pretty cool, my father did the same thing when i was a kid€¦ how did you feel when you were driving? scared? excited? did you calm down after a bit?<p class="p2"> <p class="p1">i assume you got to drive *after* you got your new glasses? ha ha.<p class="p2"> <p class="p1">for me growth mindset is about constantly working hard to improve yourself, that with hard work and effort you can achieve anything you set your mind to. it doesn't always work out that way, sometimes you need a little bit of luck, but the idea is that if you work hard enough, perhaps you can make a little bit of your own good luck, that perhaps you can give yourself the best chance. perhaps you can take the examples of colin kaepernick and alex smith€¦ both of them needed growth mindsets to get them to where they are today (starting quarterbacks for a successful team in the NFL) and both will need growth mindsets to take them further. colin kaepernick almost led the 49ers to a super bowl win€¦ and i'm sure as a competitor he's thinking that he needs to continue to work and improve in order to finally get that win. in addition, defenses may start to figure out how to defend against him (and quarterbacks like RG III, etc.), so he'll need to make sure he's constantly evolving and improving. meanwhile alex smith will want to continue his hard work with the chiefs to prove that he's also a quality quarterback despite losing his starting job to kaepernick.<p class="p2"> <p class="p1">or you could think of established quarterbacks like drew brees and tom brady: they've both already won super bowls (multiple in the case of brady), but neither one is content to sit back, both are constantly working hard and improving themselves in an effort to win another.<p class="p2"> <p class="p1">i've been spending most of this week settling into my apartment. one thing i've learned in my life is that moving€¦ sucks. -joe</div>

          <p class='email'>Hi joe,It was great to see you on Friday! I hope you had a good weekend. The high of last week for me was meeting my friend's daughter that she just adopted, she was so cute! The low is my back has really been bothering me for the past week or so. I'm going to the chiropractor tomorrow, I can't wait!<br /><br />I think a Growth Mindset is the key to life!! At the end of the day, you are in control of your destiny, and if you truly want something you can work hard for it and achieve your goal. The key is staying motivated, working really hard, and know exactly what you want.  There will always be challenges but the key is to try your hardest and not give up.I believe that Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, and any successful athlete thinks with a Growth Mindset. I saw Tiger woods in an interview a few weeks ago, and he said that he expects to win every match that he plays. He works hard, prepares mentally and physically, and has a positive attitude (like we talked about last week).  It doesn't guarentee success, but those things make it more likely than if those things aren't done. I try to live by a Growth MIndset every day, by working hard at my job and also outside of work towards my goals. I think it's important to continue this mindset even after you graduate from high school, college, or anything else in life. That way when you look back at your life, you can be proud of your actions and accomplishments.Have a great week, talk to you soon!bill</p>
