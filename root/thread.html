Also today I'm going to see my besfriend and we're going to go to the movie and other Growth mindset to me is that sometime people go to grow up to fast at a young age and sometimes you can be 35 and act like a 10 year old.

It's such an exciting experience, you will learn so much about the world and who you are.  I hope you have a great day at school tomorrow, and a great weekend!  Any plans other than your usual dance classes? Have fun and talk to you soon!  joep.s. If you haven't already, don't forget to bring the out of program form that your dad signed! I can't make it to the event on the 7th so we definitely need to hang out on our own.</p>

          <div class='email'>PK-- <p class="p1">so you got to drive over break? that's pretty cool, my father did the same thing when i was a kid€¦ how did you feel when you were driving? scared? excited? did you calm down after a bit?<p class="p2"> <p class="p1">i assume you got to drive *after* you got your new glasses? ha ha.<p class="p2"> <p class="p1">for me growth mindset is about constantly working hard to improve yourself, that with hard work and effort you can achieve anything you set your mind to. it doesn't always work out that way, sometimes you need a little bit of luck, but the idea is that if you work hard enough, perhaps you can make a little bit of your own good luck, that perhaps you can give yourself the best chance. perhaps you can take the examples of colin kaepernick and alex smith€¦ both of them needed growth mindsets to get them to where they are today (starting quarterbacks for a successful team in the NFL) and both will need growth mindsets to take them further. colin kaepernick almost led the 49ers to a super bowl win€¦ and i'm sure as a competitor he's thinking that he needs to continue to work and improve in order to finally get that win. in addition, defenses may start to figure out how to defend against him (and quarterbacks like RG III, etc.), so he'll need to make sure he's constantly evolving and improving. meanwhile alex smith will want to continue his hard work with the chiefs to prove that he's also a quality quarterback despite losing his starting job to kaepernick.<p class="p2"> <p class="p1">or you could think of established quarterbacks like drew brees and tom brady: they've both already won super bowls (multiple in the case of brady), but neither one is content to sit back, both are constantly working hard and improving themselves in an effort to win another.<p class="p2"> <p class="p1">i've been spending most of this week settling into my apartment. one thing i've learned in my life is that moving€¦ sucks. -joe</div>

          <p class='email'>Hi joe,It was great to see you on Friday! I hope you had a good weekend. The high of last week for me was meeting my friend's daughter that she just adopted, she was so cute! The low is my back has really been bothering me for the past week or so. I'm going to the chiropractor tomorrow, I can't wait!<br /><br />I think a Growth Mindset is the key to life!! At the end of the day, you are in control of your destiny, and if you truly want something you can work hard for it and achieve your goal. The key is staying motivated, working really hard, and know exactly what you want.  There will always be challenges but the key is to try your hardest and not give up.I believe that Tiger Woods, Michael Jordan, and any successful athlete thinks with a Growth Mindset. I saw Tiger woods in an interview a few weeks ago, and he said that he expects to win every match that he plays. He works hard, prepares mentally and physically, and has a positive attitude (like we talked about last week).  It doesn't guarentee success, but those things make it more likely than if those things aren't done. I try to live by a Growth MIndset every day, by working hard at my job and also outside of work towards my goals. I think it's important to continue this mindset even after you graduate from high school, college, or anything else in life. That way when you look back at your life, you can be proud of your actions and accomplishments.Have a great week, talk to you soon!bill</p>

          <p class='email'>Hello bill,    How are you? I am doing much better, in school and normally. For one thing I don't have a 65 in English anymore. But I shouldn't take a break, not yet, I still have much to improve and work on. There is lots of work to do right now and I have to organize myself better. The trip to Facebook wasn't what I was expecting but it was great. I don't think I'll ever be in an office like that ever again. You said that college isn't hard, I was kind of suprised to hear that. I expected you to write saying it was difficult and classes would be too hard.  A growth mindset is someone who doesn't come to conclusions quickly, someone who doesn't prematurely judge themselves. Someone with a growth mindset won't stop but will keep on going. Its better to have a growth mindset rather than having a fixed mindset. I think I have a growth mindset, but occasionally I see it as a fixed mindset. Sometimes if I'm doing bad at something I'll think it'll stay that way forever. Then I'll probably give up.   I think having a growth mindset is really important. Often people who are optimistic and motivated have this kind of mindset. I use growth mindset to keep me motivated and successful. I will use growth mindset for the rest of the year to help me pass all my classes and do better than before.   We can meet up for lunch, sure, how about next Wednesday (27th) at 2:15 outside my school? On Wednesday school ends earlier than usual and I am free afterschool. Anyways see you later, have a great weekend!   Sincerely,   joe </p>

          <p class='email'>Hey joe, I had a pretty good short week. My High would be the brake because I got to SLEEP! The week before, I did not get any sleep, so it was nice getting to close my eyes without having to worry about being late to something. My low was my Functions &amp; Data Analysis teacher, he needs to relax his temper because he does not have patience for anything, and I think that is a skill that all teachers should be required to do. I put my head down, and he yelled so loud, that I got scared. I didn't really care because I laughed when he did it. Then everyone started laughing at him. No one in my block really enjoys his class. Other than that my week was fine.Today in class we talked about growth mindsets. To me, a growth mindset is made up of a natural ability to do something and being a hard worker. One of my idols is Nicki Minaj. Not just because I love her music, but because of her story. She came from nothing, she didn't have much growing up, but she tried her best to succeed. She has had the mindset of being famous one day since she was little, and actually thought that she could do it. And she did. I think having a growth mindset is important because if you don't, your chances of being successful would mostly be based on luck. Class is ending so I have to go,bill</p>

          <p class='email'>Dear bill, Hi bill my break was great, I spent my week with my friends and sleeping alot. It's great that your surgery went good and you have a new job now. I became decent with python and been doing codecademy for my computer science grade. How was that event you went to? I forgot the name but was it the sony event that took place in NY?Growth mind set is when someone works hard at something for a long time then becomes a master at it. One of my heroes I guess would be iron man. I know he's not real but I can't think of a hero right now. But the reason I picked iron man is because he took alot of time fixing his suit and becoming a hero. This is why he uses the mind set skill.I do think mind set is important because to become good at somthing you need to practics. One way I use mind set is on school. I guess studying for a subject is a major reason why I pass that ceretain class.I know you cant make it to the next event but if something happens I RSVP maybe. Talk to you later in the next email.joe appleton </p>

          <p class='email'>My high point of last week was going to this Black and White Ball at St Johns on Friday.  You should've seen your boy! I was fly. haha. My low point was I had to cancel my plans to take a trip the University of Albany on Saturday.I definitely believe the Growth Mindset Theory. Although someone is born with an innate ability, nothing is guaranteed in life. You have to constantly work hard to acheive your goals and dreams. The harder you work the more you will learn and the smart you will become. Tiger and Jordan definitely use a Growth Mindset because excelling at a sport takes hours and hours of practice. I think when you look at people like at artists such as Beyonce or Usher, you can see the Growth Mindset. They may have been born with a  great voice but it took much training and practice to be able to perform their dance moves while singing. That is a very difficult task.I live by a growth mindset myself. I consider myself to be intelligent but without my hard work that wouldnt mean any thing. I know many intelligent people who are lazy and therefore do not succeed the way they can. I also know many people who worked very hard to achieve knowledge to become intelligent. Hope to see you soon. bill</p>

          <p class='email'>Hi bill,It's awesome to hear you're doing Python on codeacademy. Coursera just released a huge number of courses! I know you're busy during the year but this is a great way to explore new topics and keep learning during the summer:<br />https://www.coursera.org/coursesThe most important thing to remember with growth mind set is something you mentioned- it takes a really long time! This is sometimes easy to forget, especially with the speed of the internet, and because the media loves to highlight the exceptions (people who get lucky and somehow don't have to take a long time- like winning the lottery).Studying is definitely a reason why you pass subjects! Once you have made a habit of studying, it will probably become second-nature to execute. Just as in basketball, if you practice taking 500 shots a day, you get much better at shooting and practicing each day gets easier and easier. If you just take 500 shots once, you won't be very good at either basketball or at practicing.I am sad I won't be able to make the next event- I'll send an extra email!Best,<br />joe</p>

          <p class='email'>Hey joe,             I hope you're having a good week. It's almost the end of the week so, that's good. I didn't really have a high for this week. Nothing was too bad either this week but something bad was that some of my grades went down alot. It's cool that you're making a website. What's it about? Maybe when you're finished you can send me a link so I can see it.             A growth mindset I guess is something you get as while you do more stuff and you earn more experience in it. For example, as you take more tests you would probably either get better at it or get worse at it. If you keep practicing, you will eventually get somewhere, good or bad. Alot of other things are needed with growth mindset as well. i guess things that take effort and skill need a growth mindset.          Class is ending. Sorry the last emails were really short, nothing personal though haha. Your mentee, bill</p>

          <p class='email'>It's great that you got to see an old friend. How did you get to see him? Was it in a new hobby that you have or just randomly on the street? I just reached out to a few of my old college friends this week. We haven't spoken in a few years so it was great catching up with them.How's your eye now? I'm glad that it wasn't anything serious. Are you able to get more sleep now?Awesome! I love your outlook on having a growth mindset! I agree with you that anything you put your mind to you can definitely do it as long as you're willing to put in the hardwork and keep your eyes on the prize. I think having a positive outlook helps as well. As in anything in life you will be faced with many difficulties but having a positive mindset and a growth outlook would really help. I believe that believing you can rise out of your situation. Also knowing and understanding that you will need to work hard is very important. Especially on those days that you don't feel like doing it. We all have those days, but it's important to persevere.Definitely some people have natural abilities. I think we all have natural inclinations that help us to do better at some things than others. The important thing is to determine what you're good at and work on improving and also work on the things that you're not so good at and see how they can improve.I know I'm a culprit of working on the things that I'm good at and not working on the things that I really need to work on... but I'm working on it :)Hope to hear from you soon!</p>

          <p class='email'>&lt;&lt;Warning: it's another long email from me :-)&gt;&gt;Hey bill,I hope you're having a great week. My high was this past Sunday when I watched the Academy Awards with my Mom and sister. I've watched it since I was a little kid and always try to make an effort to watch the nominated films, which makes the show more exciting. Argo won best picture, but I really think Silver Linings Playbook deserved it. My low for the week was the crappy weather. I can't wait for the sun to be shining every day!Glad to hear you enjoyed break and got some rest. Sorry to hear about the situation with that teacher. It sounds like a difficult situation. How do you think it can be better? As a leader, think about what role can you play to make it better for you, the class and your teacher.I'm really excited to discuss growth mindset this week. I've been a huge believer in this since I graduated college and worked with middle school students. A bunch of my students didn't think they would ever be good at school and would often call themselves "dumb." What I always told them was that the harder you work, the smarter you get. I like your definition and the only thing I would add is that the hard work usually doesn't happen on your own. People who are really successful usually get a lot of support.Nicki Minaj is a great example of a growth mindset paying off, but I would like to know who supported her along the way. I think in society, people tend to believe peope become successful on their own, when it's almost always a team effort. That's why parents, teachers, mentors (shoutout to me ;-)) and coaches are so important.In my own life having a growth mindset has been extremely important. This has been my first year recruiting mentors, and I never had the experience of recruiting mentors before. I had to work hard at learning how iMentor recruits and get a lot of feedback from my peers. I'm still learning a lot every day and I still make mistakes, but that's part of the process of learning and getting better. Failing is just an important as succeeding AS LONG AS you learn from your mistakes. Does that make sense?Looking forward to hearing from you on Friday!joe</p>

          <p class='email'>Hey bill                Two highs of my week would have to be getting Tea at a Tea store around my school called Thirst Tea. It is one of those Bubble Tea stores. I had this drink called Taro Tea with Tapioca inside of it. It was AMAZING! It's really sweet which is what I like but the Tapioca doesn't really have a taste to it which would  bothers me if I ate it alone, but I think it compliments the Taro. Also my Birthday is coming up on March 8th!! So I will be turning 15. I am kind of happy because I am getting older but at the same time I am a little supersticious so I think odd numbers can be bad luck. One low of my week would have to be my sister did not  go to school today because her "neck was hurting" so my mom let her stay home. My sister always wakes me up in the morning because I am a Deep deep sleeper so I couldnt wake up for anything, but today she slept in and did not wake me up so I had to get up on my own. I usally wake up at 7:00 but know I woke up at 7:10 which only gave me 16 minutes to get ready. I think that it is so cool that you won a customized dress by Carrie Hammer I think my mom has one of her dresses so when I tell her she will be jelous. When I saw the website for Imentor I started laughing because I remeber when we where at Google that picture kept popping up. The website is really cool did Imentor help you with it or did you do it all by yourself?           To me a Growth Mindset is believing and putting effort into something that you love. For example if I wanted to learn how to type faster I have to put time and effort into doing it. I do believe that Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan use a Growth Mindset because since they were younger they practised what they liked doing ever since they were younger and they didnt do it for 10 minutes they did it for several hours a day. A person that I consider a very successful person is President Obama. I say this because he has  gotten very  far in life. Thousands of people say they want to be president but only a limited amount of people follow through and fewer people get close to being it. Even with his past he still got to where he is.             I do think growth mindset is important because if you do not put in any time or effort into something that you like you will probably not get to be it.Cheers joe appleton</p>

          <p class='email'>Dear bill, How has your week been so far?  My week has been pretty good so far and im pretty happy that today is Friday. Growth mindset means to me that you are born with a talent and you also practice that talent like for example you are good at basketball but you want to be even better so you practice. You can also say that your born with a talent but you don't think your the best you know that you still have room for improvement. I do believe that Micheal Jordan and Tiger Woods had a growth mindset because if they didn't then they would've never went to practice and they would've never attempted to be better, but they did practice so therefore they had a growth mindset. I also think LeBron James has a growth mindset because he practices a lot.I live by a growth mindset because I don't believe that I am the best in anything and I think that there is room for improvement for anything I do. This school year i've used a growth mindset in English because I had a 85 which was good for me but I believed I can do better and I ended up with a 93 which was even better.Hope you have a great weekend talk to you soon and ill see you at the next imentor event on March 7th.</p>

          <p class='email'>Hello joe,    How are you? I am doing much better, in school and normally. For one thing I don't have a 65 in English anymore. But I shouldn't take a break, not yet, I still have much to improve and work on. There is lots of work to do right now and I have to organize myself better. The trip to Facebook wasn't what I was expecting but it was great. I don't think I'll ever be in an office like that ever again. You said that college isn't hard, I was kind of suprised to hear that. I expected you to write saying it was difficult and classes would be too hard.  A growth mindset is someone who doesn't come to conclusions quickly, someone who doesn't prematurely judge themselves. Someone with a growth mindset won't stop but will keep on going. Its better to have a growth mindset rather than having a fixed mindset. I think I have a growth mindset, but occasionally I see it as a fixed mindset. Sometimes if I'm doing bad at something I'll think it'll stay that way forever. Then I'll probably give up.   I think having a growth mindset is really important. Often people who are optimistic and motivated have this kind of mindset. I use growth mindset to keep me motivated and successful. I will use growth mindset for the rest of the year to help me pass all my classes and do better than before.   We can meet up for lunch, sure, how about next Wednesday (27th) at 2:15 outside my school? On Wednesday school ends earlier than usual and I am free afterschool. Anyways see you later, have a great weekend!   Sincerely,   bill</p>

          <p class='email'>Hi bill, <br />Thanks for sharing your experience and you thoughts on mindset with me.For myself, last week was a typical week. We had a project that was due last Friday. So the good thing was that we made it. But also, we had some sort of crazy moments when we thought things should work, but they didn't. Eventually we worked it out. So overall, it was good.<br /><br />Regarding my thought on mindset, I definetely think growth mindset is the way to go. It is true that someone might be more talented than the others in some area, but the hard work can play the role there and change the game completely. for example, Even I agree Tiger Woods must be very talented at golf, however, had he not practieced for so many hours, I don't think he would have been able to achieve what he has achieved. In my own experience, I think I have seen many examples that people just achieve their golas by working hard, even if they are not good at it at the beginning. I agree with you and truely believe that you could do the same.<br /><br />Talk to you next time.<br /><br />-joe</p>

          <p class='email'>Hey joe,I just wanted to say that I had a really good time at the event last week at Pace University and I hope you did too.  I thought it was a great chance to get a feel for a college campus and hear some perspective from current students.So, how are things going since we last spoke? How is class going? Keeping those grades up and doing all your homework? I hope so!The blog post in the writing prompt was pretty interesting and I thought it definitely hit home for me. The experiences and they ability to learn were definitely the most important things I learned at college. By the way the post was written by a student from Lafayette which was my school's biggest rival so, it's hard for me to give Lafayette students credit.  Interestingly the Lehigh-Lafayette football game is the most played game in all of college.  It's a huge event every year.  I've even been going back to Pennsylvania for that game each year since I've graduated.When I was in 9th grade I really didn't know that much about college at all.  I knew I needed to do well in my classes and eventually take some tests and then send in some applications.  I cam from a family where most people didn't go to college so I didn't have anyone to lean on in terms of experience or certain steps I should take in order to get in to college.  But I'm here for you to help you along the way and provide you with my experiences and talk about what I did to prepare.Hope you're having a good week!-bill</p>

          <p class='email'>Hi bill,The last conversation that I had with Primo, I am pretty sure that there is paperwork   involved in order for us to meet outside of school.  I am going to double check with him. If that€™s fine with you, I€™ll make an arrangement with Primo to stop by the school tomorrow during lunch time.A growth mindset person is a knowledge seeker and optimist.  I strongly believe that you have the right attitude and the proper surrounding to succeed in life and college.  I am very confident about your future.Please ask Primo if I can stop by tomorrow. And hopefully we will have lunch.See you soon and have a great weekend!joe</p>

          <p class='email'>Hello joe,How are you? Thanks for the e-mail. My high this week was getting my work done in math class. I don't really have a low this week. What are your high's and lows. I enjoyed Pace University also. I had fun asking questions about college and u gave great answers now I know that I should be looking forward to college and preparing for it.The way I would define a growth mindset is that it means to keep practicing for what you want to do and it will get easier. I think that Tiger Woods and Michael joe did use a growth mindset in their own lives because at first they started of by practicing and look at them now Tiger Woods is a great golfer and Michael joe is a great basketball player.My mindset is to keep practicing to get into a good college by doing all my work and doing good on it. Also by getting good grades. Well it was nice getting to e-mailing you. BYE!!!!Sincerely,bill</p>

          <p class='email'>Hi bill,Yes I know how to ski, I was lucky growing up and my father would take me all the time. However, most of my friends had never skied until I introduced them to it. Over the years, I think I have taught eight of my friends how to ski. It's something that is frustrating at first but once you get the hang of it, it's amazing. Plus the hot tub waiting at the hotel at the bottom isn't bad either.Working on weekends is definitely not fun, I try to get my stuff done on Saturday mornings so I can enjoy the rest of my weekend. It's great that you are going at Saturday school and putting in the effort to get your grades up. I know that you know how important it is. Not to be a nag, but I can tell that your teachers are totally right, you are a very smart girl and I know you could get all A's if you put your mind to it.I am going to be corny right now and say that this plays in perfectly with our prompt about growth mindsets. That your success is a combination of the aptitude you were born with and how much effort you put in. What do you think about this?Anyways, what is new with you? Have you been playing any basketball or writing?AFTER I get my work done this weekend (Do you like how I added that in there?) I am taking another painting class this weekend, I will be sure to send you what I come out with.Also, let me know if you really want to try to do something outside of IMentor events, or if you think your father would let you. We would need to get a permission slip signed, which we can get from Primo.Ok, have a great weekend, get your schoolwork done, and then go do something fun. Work hard, play hard. YAY it's Friday!sincerely,joe</p>

          <p class='email'>Hi, joe Sorry for not completing the email. I was but then I got called out to go see the guidence counsuler. I was going to finnsh it when I got home, but my laptop is getting fixed. After a while, I thought I send a complete version but I guess not. I swear everyone I know is getting new furniture. I always see furniture trucks outside my buliding coming in and out and holding up the elevators causing me to walk up and down the stairs more offen. My mom is currently looking for new furniture and items to make our house look "classy".  I also like Burno Mars new song, I first heard it when I was shoping in Areopostale. I'm not really into cat videos, I usally watch huskey puppies/dog videos. The more I watch them, the more I want to get one. Have you heard of the new dance the Harlem Shake? I spent most of last weekend watching flash mobs of them. A growth mindset in my words is mostly something you did, but you know you could do better, expecally if you get comments on how good you did but also get some feedbacks on how you can improve it. I believe that Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan uses a growth mindset in their own lives because they are pretty much known worldwide for doing things. Tiger Woods is probley the main golfer someone can think of on the top of there heads and he is know for his skills into become a pro golfer. Michael Jordan is a basketball ledged and he can't just become a ledged out of the no where, he had to work hard over his life time to be where he's at now. Another he has a growth mindset is that he uses his power of fame and reconition to create his own brand of Jordan sneakers and apparel. Another person I think that used a growth mindset to achieve their success is Jay Z because he ahs been working towards his goal around his teen years, even through diffacult time settings in his life. Now that he is famous and REALLY rich, he still expands his growth minset and invest in things like is own clothing line, colones, charitey and he even has his own reccord label (Roc Nation). I think Jay Z growth mindset will keep expanding because more things can get him an idea to keep growing. A time I usesd a mindset is when I was first learning how to draw anime and other things. I didn't really know how to but two people who was in my class draw like they were making an anime. So over the years, I kept practicing how to draw better, I started to look at comics/ mangas and shows like Naruto and draw something from it. Everytime I tried it came out badly or half correct. So I kept practicing and now I can kind of draw what I see. From, bil</p>

          <p class='email'>Dear bill,         It's Friday again. This week, I went through many things and one highlight from my week was that I got some bagels for breakfast. I started to hate the noodles my mom always cooked for breakfast, so it's good to have something different. One challenge from my week was sleeping enough. I feel like I slept for only four hours when I had like seven hours to sleep, so there's probrably something wrong. And so, what was your high and low for the week?         Today in class, I learned about a growth mindset and fixed mindset. The definition of a growth mindset is a belief that success is a combination of the aptitude you're born with and the amount of effort and hard work you put in. For me, a growth mindset means the belief that if you work for this you will get that. One of my heroes is Michael Jordan. I do think he uses a growth mindset in his life because I watched a video about him in school. His team won many basketball games, but lost to one of the highest ranked team. Even though his team lost, they started trainning again, getting ready for the next game that will come up. After all, they went back into game and played many basketball games until they were one of the highest ranked team.         I use growth mindset too. I think it is important because it is like a plan of what you will do throughout your life. In my life, I use growth mindset by believing that if I give effort to something that I am doing, it will reward me in the future. One example of me using growth mindset this year is giving up some personal time, so I can do the school work given and keep my grade rising. And yes, the grade is the reward for this, and in the future, there may be rewards like getting into a good college. Hope to see you at the next event and have a good one. Sincerly, joe appleton</p>

I hope you has an awesome weekend.I think growth mind means in my owns word is that you can setting your mind to something and accomplish.I think Michael Jordan and Tiger woods live in a growth mindset because  he accompish something and success and became something.                  I live by a growth mind too because I try hard to success at something like pass and I never give up. Growth mindset used in this school year is that I had essay for engish to do and I didn't stop to I success It now I just finish and I can rest but I had to check over it but I did not give up on my work and I'm doing good so that one growth mindset I used this year in school.</p>

          <p class='email'>Hi bill,How are you doing bro? I hope you has an awesome weekend!Last week seemed to pass so quickly since we had Monday off. One negative thing from last week was not wearing a jacket, one day, when going outside. It was irresponsible of me and now my voice is a little hoarse. The reason it is slightly annoying is because I have to give a speech tomorrow evening and I want to be able to project my voice loudly. One positive thing about last week was having Monday off. I was able to get some extra rest and spend time doing things that make me happy, like reading. By the time I went back to work on Tuesday I had a lot of energy and was ready to do well. This prompt on having a "Growth Mindset" is a very powerful one. You have mentioned that you would like to be successful and your mindset will be crucial in helping you achieve that. I have seen you use a Growth Mindset on more than one occasion and I look forward to seeing you continue. Two examples that comes to my mind is first the time where you decided to read your answers in front of everyone at one of our imentor events. Another example is the fact that your emails keep getting more and more polished. This shows that you realize that in order to get better at something you have to continually work at it. I am proud of you.I define a Growth Mindset as a mindset that takes into account all of your strengths and areas for improvement. Taking an honest assessment of yourself helps you recognize your potential and attract opportunities that will foster your growth. Anything is possible as long as you are willing to work hard. Intelligence is developed by constantly taking steps to increase your knowledge. Are you willing to work hard repetitively? I think Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods are perfect examples of how having a Growth Mindset works. Most people are afraid of hard work, but these men knew that it was essential if they wanted to be the best at their craft. "Outliers" is a great book that goes into a lot of detail on this topic. I know you like sports. Here is a quote from Larry Bird "A winner is someone who recognizes his God-given talents, works his tail off to develop them into skills, and uses these skills to accomplish his goals." I heard that he used to shoot about 100 shots with each hand during practice! bill, this means that if you wanted to be better than him all you would have to do is commit yourself to shooting more than that every single day. In my mind being born with a gift is only the starting point. It takes commitment, commitment, commitment to make yourself outstanding.I completely live by a Growth mindset. A personal example from my life happened in college. I thought I was doing extremely well. My grades were good and I had led a number of organizations on campus. I was even recognized for different awards. One day my teacher pulled me to the side and told me that she thought I should stay far away from the work world because I was not "ready." After asking her what she meant she told me I was not convincing when I spoke in public and I should take time to enhance that skill. Of course this upset me but I decided to not let it dictate my future. I decided that I was going to get better no matter what and I have done tremendously in the past year. I simply refused to accept that some people were naturally better speakers than others. I knew that public speaking, like anything else could be improved through hard work and consistent dedication.Send me an email man, I would love to hear from you! New Word<em><strong>Stagnant</strong> (Stag-nint)- </em>Not advancing or developingbill knew that refusing to enhance his Growth Mindset would make him stagnant. Best Regards,<br />joe </p>

          <p class='email'>Wassup, joe honestly this week really sucked, i didn't get to enjoy my VACATION wasn't even a real vacation nether.I was sick since last monday not the monday that just past the monday BEFORE that monday. It really did an big inpact in my school work mostly GRADES now im FAILING everything but GYM -_______- GREAT i haven't felt so badin my life, i had this terrible migrane thats affecting my left eye so it hurts even when i write this letter to you. Plus its sobright in the classrooms it hurts to even open my eyes. I went to the hospitial and they gave me something i felt all goodbut when i went home i started feeling the same again. These teachers think im doing this on purpose, im not im really notit's like they want me to come to school even when im sick but they still gonna fail me, kinda upsets me that i had to go on a rant. Well to go back on topic i have to talk about GROWTH MINDSETS. So what a growth mindset means to me is tryingsomething out, it don't matter if your bad at it practice makes perfect, am i right? Someone who says they suck at somethingand they didn't even try it kinda has a mindset of a potato, for one reason they arn't TRYING! My 2 heroes are Michael Jordanand i don't know if you herd of him Michael Jai White. You got one idea why i love Michael Jordan, yeah the SNEAKER if i canafford to buy all of them i would instantly, well 1-14 the rest are kinda ugly to be honest. Michael Jai White is an American actor andmartial artist who is also known as an badass ass kicker haha. Movies with Michael Jai White are Blood and bone Never Back Down 2and a movie called Undisputed 2. Speaking of movies what are some that you recommend have you seen Once Apon A Time in a america?Or An American Crime.Before i go a mindset i had before was i sucked at ball one reason is because i was chubby, Haha yet now im tall and slim. But i practiced i was a chubby lebron james no i wasn't that good but i was concidered better then most people.</p>

          <p class='email'>Hey bill,I am good, thanks for asking. Happy it is Friday, and I am looking forward to the weekend even though I am going to spend it studying for a big test I have coming up. That is actually why I can't make it to the next iMentor session. I am sorry about missing the session by the way, but I have my test and I cannot reschedule it. I think my high this week was having Monday off of work and the short week. My low this week is probably all of the studying I have been doing for my big test. It is really not much of a low because it is not that bad to study for. It is for something I really want to do well in, so it is not that hard to motivate myself to work hard.I think you described a "growth mindset" very well. I absolutely agree that working hard and preparation makes all the difference in the world if you want to be good at something. I try to apply this to many aspects of life. One of the most common sayings that I try to apply to everyday life is "practice makes perfect." Whether you know it or not, you are building habits right now that you will carry with you for the rest of your life. If you practice hard work and focus on little tasks like homework and classwork, you will get better and better at these types of tasks. It is important to start embracing that kind of attitude because the work you put in now will pay off in the future. I know that if you work hard towards your goals and commit yourself to accomplishing them that you are fully capable of making it happen. That is why I am so excited that you said you want to practice doing all your work and a doing a good job on it. That is a great habit that will help prepare you for college. It is also really excited to see how hard you have worked since we started iMentor together. I have definitely noticed you working harder in school, and that is really exciting for me.One thing that I think is important to note is that the right "growth mindset" works for intelligence and school too. I remember when you told me last week that when you first came to high school, you were a little self concious because you thought that since every one was older than you that therefore they were smarter than you. But it made me really happy to hear that you don't feel that way anymore. I think this is because you applied your "growth mindset" to school and developed more skills that make you feel comfortable in school. Keep us the positive attitude in school and I know you were feel more and more intelligent as you work hard at it. I look at my Dad as an example. He works hard at his new job because he lost his last job due to the bad economy. He started his own company and worked hard at it. And now he is doing very well with his new company.Every day, I try to think about what I want to achieve and start working at it. I think of new challenges that I want to overcome. One example of this is my test coming up that is important to me. One of my goals was to go back to school for my graduate degree. As a result, I practice for my business school admissions test. I challenged myself to achieve a certain score and practice hard to accomplish that every day. Hopefully, my hard work will pay off.joe</p>

Im just excited for college i heard a lot of fun things about. I hope you have fun in miami What did you do? Im going in March im so excited and im also going in the summer for a family reunion like we every year.Growth Mindsent is a person who becomes succesful by putting in a lot of work into what they WANT to do. One person i feel like is a mindset person in Micheal Jackson because he put alot of hard work into his muisc and he also put hard work into making his music fun to hear for his fans. I feel like if he was still alive he would still be making music and still being the King of Pop. I hope i become like him one day but everyone will love me for my dancing. See you later:]</p>

          <p class='email'>Hey bill.My high this week would have to be seeing an old friend! I haven't spoken to him since 5th grade when we graduated elementary school so it was nice. I got his number too, so we talk all the time now! He has like, the same personality when we were little too so it's nice to see/know that. :) My low this week was actually pretty weird... Yesterday I came to school and I started scratching my eye. (Mind you I stayed up until 2:30am the night before talking to the guy I reunited with) So I decide to scratch my eye, then about an hour later, my friend was telling me that my eye was a little pink. I assumed it was cause I didn't get sleep because when you have pink eye, it's usually BOTH eyes. So when I woke up this morning, my eye was glued shut, and when I opened it, it was pink... Like really pink. But when I got to school it started turning back white. I thought maybe I got a minor cut on it that was itching it, hence it turned pink. Maybe it was the coffee I had that fixed it lol. :)So right now I have to talk about having a "growth mindset". So in my own words, I would say that it means believing you can succeed in anything if you were born with that skill, along with the ammount of effort you put into it. One of my heros, even though I don't really do any of the things he did, but I would say that my hero is Michael Jacksonnnn...  :) Honestly, he was really diligent and he worked at what he knew he was good at and produces memorical music and was loved by millions of people. So that makes me feel like if he can start at the bottom and work up, then I, in a somewhat good high school can make a name for myself.I think in some cases, having a growth mindset is important. I say that because if you know that you were born with this natural born talent, you would obviously want to put effort into doing what you are good at. I'm not saying that some people shouldn't go for what they know they're good at, but if you're good at something like painting, do you honestly think that you can get a good paying job as a PAINTER? Or something like singing. I mean okay, like MJ, he started at the bottom. But most people don't get to live out that carreer... I use mine because I know that I'm good with computers and things like that, but I on the other hand don't really try to put effort into it because I feel like I can get it in one shot. Then if I don't, I kinda just, give up sadly. Which I know is something I gotta change, but right now I guess I'm not in the mood to... I still have three years here.Thanks for answering those questions I had last time. Talk to you soon.</p>

          <p class='email'>Oh no bill! Not you too!! This Harlem Shake meme is not the actually the Harlem Shake!... as your elder I feel it is my duty to share this very educational video.. behold... the actual Harlem Shake! <br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt_4yv3_INw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xt_4yv3_INw</a>   Those other videos are pretty funny though :)While a growth mindset encourages positive action, I think the idea of a growth mindset is more a state of mind. It is the knowledge that YOU are in control of your own success and you can either choose to dream big, work hard and achieve your goals or you can sit around do nothing and blame others for your failures.I think Jay Z is a great example of someone with a growth mindset. He grew up with not a lot of resources at his disposal but his passion for music and drive to rise above and make a better life for himself did pay off. His career in music has allowed him many advantages and, exactly like you said, he is now a very well off entrepreneur with a record label, clothing line, and even a basketball team. Because he is so focused and driven, his career keeps evolving and I imagine he will continue to be very successful.I tried to think of another famous person with a growth mindset but there are so many; from Oprah to Bill Gates... that I decided to go with my with mother, who despite her circumstances growing up is a very successful woman.  My mother was raised in a very small town in upstate New York by my Grandmother who had left her abusive husband when my mother was about 5.  They were very poor, my grandmother working several jobs to keep food on the table and my mother taking up sewing to make her own clothes (mind you this was the 1940s &amp;50s) . My mother got her first job at 13 working as a dental assistant and has not stopped working since. My mother has her bachelors, her masters, a nursing degree, and 2 children.  She is a 2 time cancer survivor, she's run a hospital, 2 operating rooms, and at 65 is now a teacher at PACE amongst many other things. The woman is incredible. She has never complained about the bad hands life occasionally has given her and even when she fails at something she picks herself up and never looks back. She studied hard, worked harder, and continues to want to grow and learn more (recently she took up quilting... which I find hilarious).I'd like to think my mother has instilled in me a little of her mindset. I have worked very hard to be where I am today and it certainly wasn't always easy. My freshman year in college was difficult because it was the first time I was far away from my friends and family. I was determined to succeed though, so I studied hard, made new friends, and kept in touch with everyone from home until I was ok with being on my own.I think it's great that you are able to relate to a growth mindset with your drawing. You are certainly a very talented artist and as you obviously know it takes a lot of hard work and practice to be as good as you are! I always find it interesting to go back and look at some of the first drawing I did and see how I've progressed and changed over the years. You should take a look at some of the art you did a year ago and compare it to what you are able to draw today. It's cool to see that practice and dedication can really lead to improvements (this applies to all areas of life and not just drawing) in fact I bet if I practiced every day for a few weeks I would be able to do the (correct) harlem shake (though probably not well because it is hard!) :)I hope you have a great weekend! And I'll see you next Thursday!!<br /><br />-joe</p>

          <p class='email'>Hey joe,How was your weekend? Do anything exciting? My weekend was pretty relaxing for a bit and then I was cleaning / prepping my place for a visit from my father. He lives in Taiwan right now and comes over once a year to visit my brother, sister, and me. So I'm the first stop in his journey and its been interesting. Lessons learned so far this trip: 1) You will always be a kid in their eyes. 2) They will always want to know every little thing about your business. 3) You can still get yelled at when you messed up. Again, this is the first day of his trip with me. OH boy. Any projects/ major homework assignments due this week? Are you keeping up to date with your assignment schedule? I know that it can be a drag, but, from personal experience, if I don't write it down to remind me later, I usually forget about it, whether it's either personal stuff or work related stuff. Its a really useful habit to develop and can help you only in the long run. There are also apps for a smartphone that do the same thing. If you want something like that, I'll be happy to find / get you one for your phone. Anything else interesting happening this week?Yours,bill</p>
